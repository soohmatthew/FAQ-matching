These services typically include inventorying the foreign stocks underlying the ADR and managing all registration, compliance and record-keeping services.Historically, the agent banks were only able to collect the custody fees by subtracting them from the ADR dividend, however, as many ADRs do not regularly pay dividends, these banks have been unable to collect their fees.As a result, in 2009, the Depository Trust Company (DTC) received SEC approval to begin collecting these custody fees on behalf of the banks for ADRs which do not pay periodic dividends. DTC collects these fees from its participant brokers (such as IB) who hold the ADRs for their clients. These fees are referred to as pass-through fees as they are designed to be then collected by the broker from its clients.If you hold a position in a dividend paying ADR, these fees will be deducted from the dividend as they have in the past. If you hold a position in an ADR which does not pay a dividend, this pass-through fee will be reflected on the monthly statement from your brokerage of the record date in which it is assessed.", "I\u2019m opening my IB account now, should I choose cash or margin?": "Head to this link https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4945&p=configuring and choose the country you reside in, and see the difference between the benefits of cash and margin accounts.

My understanding is that they are raising capital by taking advantage of the recent spike in price.": "It is a combination of a spike in share price plus the current low interest rate environment.So they can finance their company cheaply and possibly avoid diluting the share a lot as conversion price is set higher.If you need to raise $100 mil and share price $10, then the number of shares comes to be 10 mil assuming all convert.But if the share price was $100, then only 1 mil share needs to be issued. Therefore the dilution is lessened.As for whether good or bad, it depends what they do with the money they raise. Same concept applies such that the Return on Capital > Cost of capital.So if they raise money and do nothing or like use it to pay dividends, then it can be an issue.Paying off debt is ok especially if the previous debt is at higher interest. But best is that the money is deployed to grow, strengthen and widen the moat of the company and increase its cashflow generation ability.", "When do we use EBIT and when do we use EBITDA?": "EBITDA does not take into account Depreciation and Amortization which can inflate the actual earnings of the company, especially for those that are capital intensive and asset heavy. Even though there's no actual cash flowing out in the form of D&A, the actual value of the company assets is decreasing.So looking at EBIT is still better as depreciation and amortization are real expenses unless for certain cases where the companies are not asset heavy (technology companies, software companies), which you might want to make adjustments for.If unsure, stick to EBIT to be safe.", "I am confused between RoE and RoIC. When do we use RoE and when do we use RoIC?": "RoE (Return on Equity), is calculated as net income divided by equity. RoE is based on shareholder equity value (assets - liabilities). So basically if RoE is 15%, every $1 equity the company has on book value, it\u2019s generating 15 cents of net income for the company.RoIC (Return on Invested Capital), is calculated as the sum of after-tax interest expense plus net income, divided by the sum of debt plus equity.RoIC is different in a sense that it\u2019s measuring how well the company is at being a good capital allocator because it\u2019s using the Invested Capital to generate returns.RoIC is indeed a better measure of the efficiency of the business operations in terms of the capital deployed. However, it does not measure the overall efficiency of the company as a whole and the returns you get.RoE will provide this measure instead (assume debt is conservative or no debt). Also, in a way RoE measures potential for continuous compounding.Eg. A company can have very high RoIC but very low RoE as it hoards a huge amount of cash that it does not deploy for any use.Yes, management does allocate capital well to gain high RoIC but it is not having opportunities to use the cash it has, resulting in low RoE.In such a case, it would be better to do share buyback or pay dividend.", "Should we use GAAP or non-GAAP?": "GAAP is the official reporting as required by regulation.Companies show non-GAAP usually to present a 'clearer' picture of how they might be growing.In a sense, it's the same as when we look at recurring profit margin for SaaS companies whereby we add S&M expenses back in, or for companies like Sea or JD, where we capitalize the R&D and amortize it for adjustment, etc.As for GAAP and non-GAAP, it depends on what you understand about the business model and whether those so called non-cash items can be adjusted out. Nothing wrong with non-GAAP but best to understand their adjustment to see whether it is logical. Companies have to disclose in the appendix how they arrive at the non-GAAP figures.Most companies like to use non-GAAP to present a nicer profitability picture but it may not be so.Some of the SaaS companies should do so as they are genuinely reinvesting to develop stronger competitive edge.", "What's the significance of GAAP results vs non-GAAP results?": "GAAP is the official reporting as required by regulation.Companies show non-GAAP usually to present a 'clearer' picture of how they might be growing.In a sense, it's the same as when we look at recurring profit margin for SaaS companies whereby we add S&M expenses back in, or for companies like Sea or JD, where we capitalize the R&D and amortize it for adjustment, etc.As for GAAP and non-GAAP, it depends on what you understand about the business model and whether those so called non-cash items can be adjusted out.

When companies do share buyback often, it can result in negative Total Equity over time. Hence they have a lot of treasury stock sitting on the balance sheet. Total Equity being negative in this case is ok. So long as the business is able to grow their earning power over time.On the other hand, if the Total Equity becomes negative due to the company constantly losing money or being over leverage and burden with debt and liabilities, then this is no good. Do avoid such companies.", "Why does the GIM framework require the ratio to be at a certain level? Eg. Operating margin more than 8%, Net Debt / Equity < 0.4, etc.": "We basically back tested these quantitative criteria with the historical data of many companies. So most of the time, if a company doesn't do better than these numbers, the company is not performing well and ultimately the share price either remains stagnant or declines over time.Likewise, you can set the criteria higher but that will mean that during the screening process, some opportunities will get filtered out as they might be undergoing transformation so the financial metrics might not look as good.There is always the qualitative check that comes after quantitative filtering to ensure the company is great. So it is better to relax the screening criteria to view more potential opportunities and then further filter them with the qualitative checks of PACS GASP.", "For SaaS, the general guideline of the metric for churn rate being less than 5%, is this churn rate referring to customer churn (subscription churn)? Or is the 5% for dollar churn (gross revenue churn)? Which is more important?": "Both are important.Normally, we mention it more for dollar churn as most companies don't really disclose customer churn. These days, most companies just disclose the DBNR (dollar based net retention) rate. So 5% is more to the dollar churn part. Customer churn, unless the company disclose, it is hard to tell.So ideal is for DBNR rate to be > 100% which include revenue churn (hopefully not much customer churn but rather just customer cutting back on usage), plus up-sell and cross-sell revenue gain.There might be a chance for DBNR rate to go below 100% due to a crisis situation, but it is preferable that customers cut back on usage rather than totally churning away. As long as customers don't churn, then the rebound will see the company do well again as the economy recovers and customers increase usage or even opt for up-sell and cross-sell value add.", "It has been mentioned that RoE is more important than Net Income Margin. Company with a high RoE but low Net Income Margin is still considered a good company. Why is this so?": "As mentioned, a business model that uses high volume sales might still be a good business like Costco. The net income margin is low but it more than makes up with the very high volume of sales it does.RoE is more important because it shows how efficiently the management uses shareholder equity to generate profits. This measure the return you as an investor will get too. Just need to make sure the RoE is not inflated by debt.", "What % do we use to decide whether the company is dilutive with all these share issuance or share-based compensation (SBC)?": "Search in the 10K for eitherStock-based CompensationStock optionsShare-based compensationAs for whether dilutive, you can check on per share metric performance. This ideally should be increasing over time.No point seeing if revenue or operating income or FCF is growing. You also need to know your ownership of your portion of the company, did it grow.If a company FCF per share is deteriorating over time, even if FCF grew, due to share count increasing much faster, or other per share metric deteriorate like operating income per share, etc, then the market likely will sell the company down.This is dilutive in a sense as your portion of ownership of the company earning and cashflow is decreasing.", "Price/Book (PB) ratio is usually only used for assets play. What are some examples of asset play?": "Some examples of for use of PB are construction companies, property developers, oil and gas, and banks.Asset play can also apply partially to many companies. Even like McDonald, Walmart, etc.These companies might own prime real estate which normally aren't valued properly.Regulation does not require these companies to revalue the asset they have so normally you see the purchase value held in the balance sheet.But over time, prime real estate will increase in value which won't be reflected. Of course, it is a bit useless if companies have no intention to sell off the asset as they rely on it more for operational purposes.", "There are other valuation ratios like PE/RoTE (Return on Tangible Equity) (= PEG), is this financial metric only relevant for the banking industry?": "As for use of PE/RoTE which is somewhat similar to a modified PEG ratio, it is more applicable for banks as you want to see a clearer picture by removing intangible items like goodwill, preferred shares and so on.As stated, a bank's balance sheet is different from normal companies. Using RoE to measure might present a distorted view.Why we use RoTE (as in PE/RoTE) as a close substitute to growth (as in PEG) is because that is the return the company generates on the shareholder\u2019s equity and thus it can be seen as how fast your capital is growing.", "How do I access the Teachable platform for FTI Community?": "Login to our Community Portal under Teachable from this link: https://courses.thefulltimeinvestor.comDo bookmark it for easier access in the future.
