MX.47b.381.1,correct,If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.
MX.47b.385.1,incorrect,I chose cup 2 because it has the same water 2 has more solute.
MX.47b.386.1,correct,"The solutions have the same amount of solute, there is just more on the bottom of the cup in cup 2."
MX.47b.388.1,correct,I chose A because in each cup you could put 4 spoons and it dissolved. When the fifth scoop went in it did not dissolve. The undissolved part is not part of the solution.
MX.47b.418.1,incorrect,Once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.47b.421.1,correct,My choice is A because it might weigh the same and they both is saturated.
MX.47b.422.1,correct,Because both of the cups one and 2 have the same amount of concentrations because they are both saturated.
MX.47b.423.1,correct,They are the same because once a solution is saturated it cannot go further.
MX.47b.425.1,incorrect,I chose cup 2 because it has more solute in it.
MX.47b.426.1,incorrect,I picked C because cup 2 has more solute than cup one.
MX.47b.434.1,incorrect,Because it has more spoons of solute but it has the same amount of water.
MX.47b.453.1,incorrect,Because there is the same amount of solvent but there is more solute in cup 2.
MX.47b.455.1,correct,"Each solution has same amount of water, which means they both hold the same amount of solute after saturation."
MX.47b.457.1,correct,Because they are both at the highest point of concentration.
MX.47b.460.1,incorrect,Because it is the same.
MX.47b.462.1,incorrect,It does not show how much dissolved and how much did not.
MX.47b.488.1,incorrect,Because both cup one and 2 are already concentrated. Neither cup one or 2 can hold any more solvent.
MX.47b.498.1,incorrect,"Because Tabby said that the solute and water were the same and I believe him and it says that they both have the same thing on the bottom clear, material on the bottom."
MX.47b.504.1,incorrect,It clearly states that 2 has more.
MX.47b.524.1,incorrect,Because is look like it.
MX.47b.531.1,incorrect,Same water but more scoops.
MX.47b.532.1,incorrect,Because both looked alike to me.
MX.47b.540.1,incorrect,Because cup 2 have 8 spoons.
MX.47b.541.1,incorrect,I think that the answer is cup 2 because it has more spoons.
MX.47b.556.1,incorrect,Because solution 2 is more concentrate because it has more spoonfuls.
MX.47b.563.1,incorrect,I put C because cup 2 has more spoons of solute so it would be heavier.
MX.47b.567.1,incorrect,"Because cup 2 has more salt, 8 spoons and because it has more material on the bottom."
MX.47b.571.1,incorrect,I put A because it is the same because it the same amount of water and only 2 scoops more than the other one.
MX.47b.595.1,incorrect,I would need to know how much stuff is at the bottom.
MX.47b.597.1,incorrect,Because they have the same amount of water but cup 2 has more spoons of solute.
MX.47b.598.1,incorrect,Both have the same because they have the same milliliters of water and they are both the same.
MX.47b.604.1,incorrect,Cup one might have 6 spoons of solute and cup 2 has 8 spoons and both have 50 milliliters of water.
MX.47b.635.1,incorrect,Cup one has less material on the bottom.
MX.47b.638.1,incorrect,Because cup one has the same amount of water but different amount of solute.
MX.47b.640.1,incorrect,"The solutions both have the same amount of water, but not the same amount of clear material on the bottom. So cup one wins."
MX.47b.641.1,correct,"Because both are saturated, and if you used 6 spoons for cup 2 both cups are still saturated."
