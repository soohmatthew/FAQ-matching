LF.26b2.393.1,incorrect,As the contour lines get closer the mountain side gets steeper.
LF.26b2.403.1,incorrect,The lines are close together.
LF.26b2.408.1,incorrect,You can tell because it is at the top and it is 5000.
LF.26b2.416.1,incorrect,Because the contour lines are closer than the others.
LF.26b2.417.1,incorrect,I can tell because the contour lines closer.
LF.26b2.421.1,incorrect,S because it is closer together.
LF.26b2.430.1,incorrect,It is steeper because it is below sea level.
LF.26b2.433.1,incorrect,Because it looks like it is going further down than the others.
