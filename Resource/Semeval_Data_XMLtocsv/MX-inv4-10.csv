MX.10.387.1,incorrect,Jorge knew a chemical reaction was occurred because it started bubble.
MX.10.390.1,incorrect,Because the mixture bubbled.
MX.10.396.1,correct,Because gas being formed can be a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.400.1,correct,Because he knew the bubbles meant carbon dioxide was being formed.
MX.10.419.1,correct,Because the balloon expanded and filled with gas and it bubbled up.
MX.10.421.1,correct,Because it started to bubble or to fizz and it is the proof of gas.
MX.10.423.1,incorrect,Because when it bubbles that means a reaction is taking place.
MX.10.425.1,incorrect,Because bubbling is a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.429.1,incorrect,Because it bubbled.
MX.10.434.1,incorrect,Because the solution began to bubble.
MX.10.435.1,incorrect,Because whenever it fizzes or bubbles that means it is a reaction.
MX.10.436.1,correct,Because the bubbles appear it makes a gas.
MX.10.453.1,incorrect,He knew because there are bubbles in the container.
MX.10.458.1,incorrect,Bubble.
MX.10.462.1,correct,Because gas bubbles appeared.
MX.10.463.1,correct,He knew because first he put a material in the water and started to bubble and that made gas so that is a clue of a chemical reaction.
MX.10.466.1,correct,Because there were gas bubbles.
MX.10.468.1,incorrect,Because he saw it bubble up that is why he knew it was a chemical reaction.
MX.10.492.1,incorrect,When he put the solid in the liquid it start to bubbles.
MX.10.493.1,incorrect,Because it bubbled and fizz.
MX.10.498.1,incorrect,Because it bubbled and when something bubbled it means a reaction occurred.
MX.10.502.1,incorrect,Because the solution bubbled.
MX.10.532.1,incorrect,I think it is because it started to bubble and because it would not do that if it was not a reaction.
MX.10.541.1,incorrect,He knew because it bubbled.
MX.10.543.1,incorrect,"Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred, because the mixture began to bubble."
MX.10.568.1,correct,He knew because a change occurred and it made a gas.
MX.10.575.1,correct,He knew because when bubbles pop a gas is released into the air.
MX.10.576.1,correct,"Because it was making gas, it was fizzing, it made some precipitant."
MX.10.597.1,incorrect,Because the solution started to bubble.
MX.10.604.1,incorrect,Because the container started to bubble up.
MX.10.605.1,incorrect,Because he saw it fizz and bubble up.
MX.10.611.1,incorrect,Because bubble appeared when he add the solid material.
MX.10.612.1,incorrect,Because it bubbled and if it bubbles then it is a reaction.
MX.10.633.1,incorrect,A chemical reaction is when something happens if you add a material and a liquid together and something happens it is a chemical reaction.
MX.10.638.1,correct,Because it started to bubble and have a gas.
MX.10.644.1,incorrect,Because his experiment took action right away with no waiting.
