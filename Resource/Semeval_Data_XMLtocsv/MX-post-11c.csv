MX.11c.101.1,incorrect,Greater than because mixture 5 has the same amount of water with more spoons of solid.
MX.11c.113.1,incorrect,Greater than because it have 5 spoon of clear material.
MX.11c.151.1,incorrect,Mixture 5 because they have the same amount of water but mixture 5 has more spoon.
MX.11c.243.1,incorrect,Greater than mixture 4.
MX.11c.255.1,incorrect,It is the same because it has the same stuff at the bottom.
MX.11c.347.1,correct,"The same because in the picture of mixture 4 and 5, they show the same salt on the bottom."
MX.11c.364.1,incorrect,They are the same and equal concentrated.
MX.11c.381.1,correct,"Mixtures is the same concentration, because both of the mixtures are saturated."
MX.11c.384.1,incorrect,It is greater than because mixture 4 has more room to dissolve than mixture 5.
MX.11c.386.1,correct,"The same, because both solutions have the same saturation point so they have the same concentration and amount of solid."
MX.11c.390.1,correct,The same because they both reached the saturation point.
MX.11c.399.1,correct,They are the same amount concentrated because they have the same amount of water and dissolved material.
MX.11c.416.1,incorrect,It is greater than because they have the same amount of water but 5 has one more spoon than 4.
MX.11c.418.1,correct,They are the same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.11c.423.1,correct,The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.
MX.11c.425.1,incorrect,The concentration is more in 5 because it has more material in it.
MX.11c.432.1,incorrect,Greater than.
MX.11c.433.1,correct,"They are the same because when a solution is saturated, it is at its highest point of concentration."
MX.11c.439.1,correct,They are the same because when the solution is saturated it is at its highest point of concentration.
MX.11c.456.1,correct,The same because both solutions are saturated.
MX.11c.460.1,incorrect,No because 5 has more scoops than 4.
MX.11c.463.1,correct,Same because if they all have the same water and 4 is concentrated with 4 scoops and 5 with 5 scoops then the solubility is the same because of the same amount of water become crystal.
MX.11c.465.1,incorrect,Same as mixture 4 because you cannot see them.
MX.11c.469.1,incorrect,Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4 because it has the same amount of water and at the bottom it is both clear material but it does not have the same amount of solid.
MX.11c.502.1,incorrect,No because there is one extra spoon in 5.
MX.11c.531.1,correct,Same because they are both saturated and it can only hold an equal amount.
MX.11c.533.1,incorrect,Greater than because it has more scoops.
MX.11c.557.1,incorrect,The same because it has the same amount of water.
MX.11c.560.1,correct,Same. Because they are both saturated.
MX.11c.572.1,incorrect,The same because they both have the same amount of water.
MX.11c.575.1,incorrect,The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its greatest concentration.
MX.11c.626.1,incorrect,"One, 2, 3 they all are clear with no material on the bottom."
MX.11c.633.1,correct,They both have material on the bottom.
MX.11c.635.1,correct,Same they both are clear and there is material on bottom.
MX.11c.636.1,incorrect,It is greater than because it has one more spoon of the solid.
