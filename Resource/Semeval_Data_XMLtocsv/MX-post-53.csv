MX.53.106.1,incorrect,He could see what solid used and he will find out what it is.
MX.53.113.1,incorrect,He should look for the solid material in his house or store.
MX.53.157.1,correct,You can tell by the way the crystals are shaped.
MX.53.181.1,incorrect,He can probably look in a book or something to find out. All crystals are different.
MX.53.248.1,incorrect,The crystals help him by making solid materials.
MX.53.261.1,incorrect,Salt.
MX.53.282.1,incorrect,"To see if it was Epsom salt, salt, citric acid or calcium chloride."
MX.53.347.1,incorrect,I going to put salt and water and leave it for some days and it is going to turn into crystals.
MX.53.366.1,incorrect,If you put citric acid the crystals will be like a influx.
MX.53.384.1,correct,I think it will help be by the shape and what has on it.
MX.53.385.1,correct,How they look like x means salt.
MX.53.400.1,correct,"Since different materials have different crystals, like salt is a x, then you can figure out what material has the same characteristic shape as the crystal that were from that particular solution, then he knows what material was used."
MX.53.418.1,incorrect,Because by the markings and patterns on the crystals your all to identify them.
MX.53.423.1,incorrect,Because no 2 crystals are the same.
MX.53.426.1,incorrect,Because a crystal identifies the solute!
MX.53.435.1,incorrect,He could check the crystals with a magnifying glass.
MX.53.436.1,correct,If he has a chart he can just match to whichever one it looks like.
MX.53.438.1,incorrect,He can mate the crystals to the solid material.
MX.53.454.1,incorrect,He would look up that type of crystal in a book and find out what type it is.
MX.53.457.1,incorrect,He could match the crystals with other crystals.
MX.53.458.1,incorrect,Show them the crystals.
MX.53.461.1,incorrect,The crystals might have salt in them.
MX.53.497.1,incorrect,He could compare the crystals to other crystals.
MX.53.525.1,correct,Whatever the crystals look most like.
MX.53.560.1,incorrect,He can compare them with other crystals he can make and that will tell him.
MX.53.566.1,correct,The crystals can identify what solid was used in the solution by its shape.
MX.53.572.1,incorrect,He will know because he will see stuff at the bottom.
MX.53.592.1,incorrect,You can use your own mixtures and see what it looks like.
MX.53.613.1,correct,Use all the salt then wait for them to evaporate but in the other trays name them by the salt so he would know which one is which but then there done he can see which one looks like that one.
MX.53.630.1,incorrect,Because all solid has different crystals.
MX.53.635.1,incorrect,Take other crystals and compare to see which ones are kind of the same.
MX.53.637.1,correct,How the crystals were shaped and how they looked.
MX.53.643.1,correct,He can look at them really hard and compare them with others.
MX.53.644.1,incorrect,Adam can try to make crystals and if the solution he used makes crystals then that is the same solution his friend used.
