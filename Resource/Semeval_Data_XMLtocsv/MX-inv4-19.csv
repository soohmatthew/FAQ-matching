MX.19.387.1,incorrect,Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.
MX.19.390.1,incorrect,Because the baking soda and citric acid started out plain but when you poured water in it reacted.
MX.19.392.1,incorrect,Because it shows and once you see it you will know that it is a chemical reaction because it starts to look like little bubbles and that is what a chemical reaction is.
MX.19.423.1,correct,Because it indicates something else is produced.
MX.19.425.1,incorrect,Because the chemicals clash and fizz.
MX.19.426.1,correct,Because It means that it is a gas or new material!
MX.19.432.1,correct,It created a gas and new material was made.
MX.19.438.1,incorrect,Because the 2 solutes and the solvent made a gas.
MX.19.439.1,correct,It indicates a gas.
MX.19.453.1,incorrect,Because the bubble makes the solution or mixture different.
MX.19.454.1,incorrect,Because it was letting out gas.
MX.19.459.1,incorrect,Gas was in it so that why it start fizzing.
MX.19.463.1,correct,It is a clue because it is making a gas and that is a clue so you know that a chemical reaction is about to happen.
MX.19.464.1,incorrect,Because you made a gas.
MX.19.467.1,correct,Because a chemical reaction creates gas bubbles or a precipitate.
MX.19.469.1,incorrect,It was fizzing because when he a mix baking soda and citric acid together the fizzing have meant that it dissolved and made bubbles.
MX.19.473.1,incorrect,Because it shows that something other than just doing nothing.
MX.19.487.1,correct,Because something has to happen for the precipitate to be made.
MX.19.492.1,incorrect,Because fizzing is created by gas bubbles.
MX.19.494.1,correct,Because fizzing is a sign of gas leaving a material and that is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.496.1,correct,Because when it does that you know that you have made gasses and gasses are made when chemical reactions occur.
MX.19.500.1,incorrect,Fizzing is a reaction.
MX.19.501.1,correct,Sometimes because fizzing means that gas is escaping and that is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.502.1,incorrect,Because if it was just water it would not fizz.
MX.19.560.1,correct,Because when it fizzes there is gas and that is a sign of a chemical reaction.
MX.19.563.1,correct,It is evidence because it made gas and fizzing occurs only when one material does not like the other one.
MX.19.564.1,correct,Fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction because when it fizzes it means it is producing gas.
MX.19.575.1,correct,It is a chemical reaction because it made a gas and a gas only appears if there is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.595.1,incorrect,Something happened so it is a reaction.
MX.19.597.1,incorrect,Because fizzing is a reaction and so it had to be a chemical reaction.
MX.19.604.1,incorrect,Because you are putting 2 mixtures together so when it starts fizzing that is how you know it is a chemical reaction.
MX.19.605.1,incorrect,Because it did something.
MX.19.608.1,incorrect,Because it fizzed and moved so that is how.
MX.19.612.1,incorrect,Because it is bubbling and bubbling is a reaction when you mix stuff together and it bubbles.
MX.19.626.1,incorrect,Because when more than 2 chemicals are mixed it produces fizzing.
MX.19.635.1,incorrect,Because the material before did not use to fizz until they were put together.
