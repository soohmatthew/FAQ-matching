MX.11e.143.1,incorrect,He could use a paper filter decided what he is using or a screen.
MX.11e.176.1,incorrect,He could get a filter and pour the solution into to it with a cup under.
MX.11e.248.1,incorrect,Jim could separate dissolved water by using a filter. The water turns clear.
MX.11e.261.1,incorrect,Let it evaporate.
MX.11e.347.1,incorrect,Get a filter paper and pour the dissolve mixture and the solid will stay in the filter.
MX.11e.364.1,incorrect,The solid will maybe dry up and water will stay the same.
MX.11e.366.1,incorrect,It dissolves and weigh 100 milliliters still.
MX.11e.393.1,incorrect,Jim could evaporate the solution. The water would go into the air and turn into a gas but the salt would stay behind.
MX.11e.396.1,incorrect,He can evaporate mixture one. The water would become a gas and some kind of crystal would be left.
MX.11e.419.1,incorrect,He could filter it and the solid could be in the filter and the water could be in the cup.
MX.11e.426.1,correct,He could put in a evaporation tray and see the solid material!
MX.11e.432.1,incorrect,Evaporate the water so there is just the solid.
MX.11e.438.1,incorrect,"He could evaporate the solution, the water would evaporate and the solid will be left behind."
MX.11e.452.1,incorrect,It could evaporate the water from the salt. The solid crystallized and the water turned into a gas called water vapor.
MX.11e.455.1,correct,"Pour the solution into evaporating dishes. The water evaporates, or turns into a gas, and the solid crystallizes."
MX.11e.457.1,incorrect,He could evaporate the solution and the water would be in the air and the solid would be in the container.
MX.11e.459.1,incorrect,It dissolves into the air bubble.
MX.11e.464.1,incorrect,"Evaporate. The solid would crystallize, and the water would become vapor and go into the clouds."
MX.11e.467.1,incorrect,Put the solution in an evaporation plate and let it dissolve.
MX.11e.468.1,incorrect,You can get a coffee filter you pour it in the you wait for it to seep into the coffee filter.
MX.11e.471.1,incorrect,Jim could use a coffee filter to separate the solid from the water. Now the water and the solid are separated.
MX.11e.491.1,incorrect,Jim could evaporate the solution.
MX.11e.496.1,incorrect,He could filter out the dissolved with a dry filter. And the water will be in its own cup.
MX.11e.497.1,incorrect,He could filter out the solid. Or evaporate the water.
MX.11e.502.1,incorrect,Evaporate the solute. The water dissolves and the solute will turn into crystals.
MX.11e.527.1,incorrect,You could let the water evaporate and there will probably be something left over in the dish or cup.
MX.11e.541.1,incorrect,He can use a filter.
MX.11e.564.1,incorrect,"He could take a filter, 2 cups, and put one under the filter paper and pour it through. So the solid would end up in the filter and the water in the cup."
MX.11e.566.1,correct,Jim could put the solution in an evaporation dish and the solid will be the crystals and the water will evaporate.
MX.11e.574.1,incorrect,"First he could take a wet filter paper, put a clear cup with nothing in it underneath it, then pour the solution through the filter paper."
MX.11e.592.1,correct,Jim could pour the water onto a plate and have the water evaporate and the solid will crystallize.
MX.11e.605.1,incorrect,You could not do it.
MX.11e.635.1,incorrect,Use a filter to separate the. The solid will stay in filter and water will just go through.
MX.11e.638.1,incorrect,1. Take a paper filter. 2. Get the filter wet. 3. Pour the mixture in. 4. Let the filter dry. 5. The mixture is separated.
MX.11e.640.1,incorrect,He could put it through a filter and then he would be able to see the crystals.
