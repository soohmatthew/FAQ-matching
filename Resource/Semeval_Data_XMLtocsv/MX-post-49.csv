MX.49.113.1,incorrect,"Y, y because it have to be less."
MX.49.128.1,incorrect,"X, I chose x because x is more concentrated."
MX.49.140.1,correct,"X, well concentration is when you compare equal amount of volume of 2 solutions and one heavier it is more concentrated so that is how I know."
MX.49.143.1,incorrect,"Y, y has less material on bottom."
MX.49.151.1,incorrect,"X, they have the same amount of water but cup x has more citric acid."
MX.49.181.1,incorrect,"X, I know because when something is more concentrated it is also heavier."
MX.49.214.1,incorrect,"X, cup x is more heavier."
MX.49.228.1,incorrect,"X, because x is more heavier than cup y."
MX.49.248.1,incorrect,"X, because is heavier then y."
MX.49.255.1,incorrect,"X, cup x because it has more sugar in it."
MX.49.261.1,incorrect,"X, x because it is heavier."
MX.49.267.1,correct,"X, I know cup x is more concentrated because on the balance cup x is heavier and cup y is less concentrated."
MX.49.304.1,incorrect,"X, how I know is because concentrated means the heaviest."
MX.49.356.1,incorrect,"X, I know because when a solution has more solid, has a better taste, or weighs more it is more concentrated than the other one."
MX.49.381.1,incorrect,"X, x has less room to move around and y has less room to move around."
MX.49.389.1,incorrect,"X, I know that solution x is more concentrated."
MX.49.390.1,incorrect,"X, Because it weighed more than cup y."
MX.49.391.1,incorrect,"X, It is lighter."
MX.49.419.1,incorrect,"Y, is more concentrated because cup x is on the floor and that is not good, right?"
MX.49.421.1,incorrect,"X, because it have more solid in it and it is heavier."
MX.49.423.1,incorrect,"X, because it is heavier."
MX.49.426.1,incorrect,"X, Because cup x is more heavier!"
MX.49.431.1,incorrect,"X, the more concentrated is cup x is heavier."
MX.49.437.1,incorrect,"X, because the material gave it weight."
MX.49.453.1,incorrect,"X, well on a balance is on the bottom and if it can lift the other solution it is more concentrated."
MX.49.455.1,incorrect,"X, Cup x must have been more concentrated because it is heavier."
MX.49.502.1,incorrect,"X, usually the heaviest cup on the balance is the most concentrated cup."
MX.49.527.1,incorrect,"X, I think it is because it heavier. Remember I said I think."
MX.49.528.1,incorrect,"X, it is heavier."
MX.49.532.1,incorrect,"X, because it seem more concentrated then y."
MX.49.541.1,correct,"X, cup x because it is more heavy."
MX.49.566.1,incorrect,"X, I know cup x is the most concentrated because it weighs the most."
MX.49.569.1,incorrect,"X, I know solution x is more concentrated because it is heavier than solution y."
MX.49.577.1,incorrect,"X, They added more solute into the solution x than solution y. That is why solution x is heavier."
MX.49.613.1,correct,"X, because x is on the bottom of the weighing thing while y is on the top."
MX.49.642.1,incorrect,"X, because cup x weighs more than cup y."
