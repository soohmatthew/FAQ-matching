EM.46.137.1,incorrect,It if looks like salt then the salt is salt crystals. If it has lines in them it is calcite crystals.
EM.46.141.1,incorrect,Calcite is straight lines.
EM.46.147.1,correct,The calcite crystals have lines. Salt crystal have squares.
EM.46.149.1,correct,The calcite crystals were lines and the salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
EM.46.153.1,correct,You can tell them apart because the calcite is just lines. The salt crystals were pyramids and squares.
EM.46.281.1,incorrect,"Calcite look like this the salt, drew picture, crystals look like this, drew picture."
EM.46.284.1,incorrect,Salt crystals had an X on them and calcite crystals do not.
EM.46.288.1,incorrect,The salt crystals look like squares.
EM.46.356.1,incorrect,The salt crystals were square and the calcite had stripes.
EM.46.383.1,incorrect,"When the crystals of the mock rock you could see them really good and with the minerals, calcite, they were hard to see."
EM.46.397.1,incorrect,I know that crystals are different than salt crystals because the salt crystals do not have needle like structures.
EM.46.399.1,incorrect,"They both have different crystals in them, the ones that are white are whiter than the calcite test crystals."
EM.46.406.1,correct,"The calcite crystals looked liked small white needles, the salt crystals were small white globs and squares with Xs and diamonds."
EM.46.409.1,incorrect,Well the vinegar if you beating a rock it will store bowl.
EM.46.422.1,correct,The crystals were points and the salt crystal were Xs.
EM.46.428.1,incorrect,The salt crystals have Xs and the others do not.
EM.46.431.1,incorrect,One of them was whiter than the other and had more crystals.
EM.46.432.1,incorrect,I can tell the difference because calcite crystals spread out and salt crystals look like squares.
EM.46.433.1,incorrect,The salt crystals have Xs in them and the other ones look different.
EM.46.491.1,incorrect,They are different because crystals from the calcite test are not minerals and the salt crystals are minerals.
EM.46.494.1,correct,I can they are different because of their shape calcite crystals look like needles and salt had squares with Xs inside them.
EM.46.508.1,incorrect,The salt crystals have little Xs and are square shape.
EM.46.523.1,incorrect,Because the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them and the calcite crystals were and did not make shapes.
EM.46.557.1,incorrect,The crystals have Xs inside when calcite has like white spot.
EM.46.561.1,incorrect,The calcite can be white and crystals is black.
EM.46.572.1,incorrect,Salt crystals had Xs and the crystals did not.
EM.46.576.1,incorrect,The crystals did not look much like calcite but the did not look like salt either.
EM.46.599.1,correct,Because the crystals from the calcite test were long and skinny. The salt crystals were fat and had designs on.
EM.46.605.1,correct,The calcite crystals had tall needle patterns and the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them.
EM.46.607.1,incorrect,The difference is the mineral have a little X in the rock have more color.
EM.46.609.1,correct,Because the crystals from calcite look like little needles and the salt crystals had squares with Xs on them.
EM.46.615.1,incorrect,The one has Xs is the one look like sauce.
EM.46.626.1,incorrect,"Calcite crystals, salt crystals, acid, vinegar."
EM.46.630.1,incorrect,"A crystal is signet, and has stuff in the middle. The calcite is clear smooth. Salt crystals look like something is dried up."
EM.46.634.1,incorrect,If you have a bowl and inside there is a crystal and you put vinegar in the bowl if it has calcite it will look like needles with salt it will look like yes.
EM.46.649.1,incorrect,"Calcite crystals, long needles. Salt crystals, X shape."
