EV.22a.111.1,correct,"No, Because John changed 2 variables not one. They are Pot A 25 milliliters of water 2 grams of food, Pot B 100 milliliters of water one gram of food."
EV.22a.114.1,incorrect,"No, He did no have a controlled experiment."
EV.22a.115.1,correct,"No, He did not do a good job because he changed 2 variables; water and food."
EV.22a.116.1,incorrect,"Yes, It seems to be going fine well."
EV.22a.117.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he did not have Pot B the same as Pot A."
EV.22a.118.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because the way he made the chart to stay organized."
EV.22a.119.1,correct,"No, Because he changed 2 variables."

EV.22a.125.1,correct,"No, Because he changed 2 variables."
EV.22a.126.1,incorrect,"No, Because in Pot A he used 75 milliliters then Pot B had 100 milliliters it is a big difference."
EV.22a.128.1,correct,"No, He changed the water and the food and to have a controlled experiment you can only change one variable."
EV.22a.133.1,incorrect,"No, He does not tell if the plant got sunlight or oxygen."
EV.22a.138.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he did the same thing a scientist would do by jotting down notes."

EV.22a.242.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he used different amount of water and food and also watched both of them each day."
EV.22a.244.1,incorrect,"No, He only used 2 kinds of pots. John needs more types of variables being changed."
EV.22a.245.1,incorrect,"No, Because not only does he need more conditions but I still do not see the right amount of variables. The results do not really explain much."

EV.22a.265.1,incorrect,"No, Because he did not control any variables."
EV.22a.276.1,incorrect,"No, Because he did not feed the plant more if he did it will be a good job."
EV.22a.285.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he did not put that much water it still few about 8 centimeters."
EV.22a.293.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because they both did not die and he found out his answer."
EV.22a.295.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because the plants few food and you can see that the plants got good amount of water."
EV.22a.296.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he used separated pots and did either more or less water and different things."
EV.22a.299.1,incorrect,"Yes, one is different than the other one."
EV.22a.300.1,correct,"No, Because he could of kept water the same and the food so that is not controlling the variables good."
EV.22a.311.1,incorrect,"No, Because he could say what color and where he left them."
EV.22a.314.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he kept track of them he made a chart so he is doing a good job."
EV.22a.320.1,correct,"No, Because he did not put the same amount of water or food."
EV.22a.321.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because the water amount is just right and from giving the plant food."
EV.22a.326.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he did different amounts of water a plant food to see which one would grow better."
EV.22a.328.1,correct,"No, Because the reason Pot B did not do so well could be too much water, or no enough plant food, you could not know."
EV.22a.329.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he records his data and puts the same amount in one pot then does the same thing to another but another amount."
EV.22a.330.1,incorrect,"Yes, John did a good job he put how much water, how much plant food, the length, the number of leaves. I like how he did his experiment."
EV.22a.331.1,incorrect,"Yes, If he is trying to find the optimum condition he needs to test different stuff on each pot."
EV.22a.333.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because John kept track of everything he was doing so he did not forget to do anything, and contained the whole project."

EV.22a.437.1,incorrect,"No, Because it seems that he got a mix up for the plants on the water."
EV.22a.443.1,incorrect,"Yes, I think he did a good job because he tested the same plant in different pots and put different amounts of water and food. It was good that he tested 2 because if he only had one he would not have anything to compare it with and find if it is good or not."
EV.22a.444.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because he used different amounts of water and food. He also used the same type of soil in both pots."
EV.22a.445.1,incorrect,"Yes, I think he did well controlling his variable because by the chart it looks no variables happened."

EV.22a.503.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because the plants grew well."
EV.22a.504.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because he put more water in one but less food and the other one was vice versa but few more leaves and in length."
EV.22a.508.1,correct,"No, Because he did not add the same amount of water or plant food."
EV.22a.524.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he used one variable waters it was not all the same."
EV.22a.530.1,correct,"No, no because in pot A he put 2 grams of plant food and in pot B one gram of plant food and he is only suppose to change water."
EV.22a.532.1,incorrect,"Yes, yes because in pot B it was 100 and one gram and length it is 7 and for number it is only and it is good."
EV.22a.533.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he wrote all his information."
EV.22a.534.1,incorrect,"Yes, because on pot A he used 75 milliliters and got one more centimeters then pot B also he got more leaves on his plant in pot A."
