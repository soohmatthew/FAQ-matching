MX.46b.386.1,incorrect,B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.
MX.46b.391.1,incorrect,They are the same amount of water different in spoons. That is why B weighs more because of spoons.
MX.46b.425.1,incorrect,Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.
MX.46b.429.1,incorrect,I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.
MX.46b.437.1,incorrect,Because he pour only 50 milliliters of solution in each cup.
MX.46b.439.1,incorrect,Because B is the double of A.
MX.46b.457.1,incorrect,Because cup B has more spoons of the solute and has more water.
MX.46b.464.1,incorrect,"Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong."
MX.46b.466.1,incorrect,I think the second one because B has more scoops of solute.
MX.46b.467.1,incorrect,Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.
MX.46b.471.1,incorrect,I picked cup B because I thought it would have more spoons of solute than cup A.
MX.46b.472.1,correct,I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.
MX.46b.488.1,correct,Because 2 is half of 4 spoons and 50 milliliters is half of 100.
MX.46b.493.1,correct,Because Nigel took out the same amount of solutions. There is 2 spoons for 50 milliliters of water. The concentration are the same.
MX.46b.495.1,correct,They both have 2 spoonfuls per 50 milliliters so when you compare 50 milliliters from each they both have 2 spoonfuls in the 50 milliliters.
MX.46b.499.1,incorrect,Because they both have the same amount of water but have different amount of salt.
MX.46b.502.1,incorrect,I think cup B would be more heavy because cup B is more concentrated.
MX.46b.524.1,incorrect,They are going to be even.
MX.46b.528.1,incorrect,Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.
MX.46b.540.1,incorrect,Because solution B has more water in the top.
MX.46b.542.1,correct,Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.
MX.46b.559.1,correct,"They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water."
MX.46b.561.1,incorrect,B because it gave 100 milliliters water and 4 spoons of solute. And A gave 5 milliliters water 2 spoon of salt so I stay with B.
MX.46b.563.1,correct,I chose the same because he took bottle A and half of bottle B and half of bottle B equals A.
MX.46b.570.1,incorrect,It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.
MX.46b.575.1,incorrect,"All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other."
MX.46b.595.1,incorrect,Solution would need to be doubled.
MX.46b.597.1,incorrect,Because he took the same amount from each bottle.
MX.46b.598.1,incorrect,Because they both have the same amount of solution in each cup. So both cups weigh the same.
MX.46b.605.1,correct,Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.
MX.46b.608.1,incorrect,Because there is more water and solute.
MX.46b.612.1,incorrect,I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.
MX.46b.630.1,incorrect,I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.
MX.46b.640.1,incorrect,Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.
MX.46b.643.1,incorrect,Cup B because it is just double.
