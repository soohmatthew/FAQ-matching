LP.16d.106.1,incorrect,It is harder to use this system than to use a single fixed pulley system.
LP.16d.137.1,correct,You have to pull up and in the other system you will pull down.
LP.16d.142.1,incorrect,The system is single movable system but the single fixed is easier to pull down.
LP.16d.149.1,incorrect,Pull down.
LP.16d.152.1,correct,It has direction advantage it can go up and down.
LP.16d.179.1,correct,In a single fixed gravity creates a directional advantage. But in this one gravity pulls against you when pulling up.
LP.16d.212.1,incorrect,You have to pull more ropes and a single fixed requires more effort.
LP.16d.214.1,incorrect,You have to use more effort because you pull down.
LP.16d.244.1,incorrect,The amount of ropes supporting it.
LP.16d.263.1,incorrect,Single fixed pulley system a smaller effort and only one mechanical advantage.
LP.16d.290.1,incorrect,Single fixed only has one rope connected to the load.
LP.16d.314.1,incorrect,It would make it harder because if you divide 360 by how many supporting ropes a single fixed pulley has which is one then it would be 360 newtons for the effort that is 180 newtons harder to lift the load.
LP.16d.333.1,incorrect,There are more materials.
LP.16d.346.1,incorrect,You do not have to pull much rope with the single fixed but it is heavier.
LP.16d.350.1,correct,"The other disadvantage to this system is the effort is going up, so gravity is working against you."
LP.16d.353.1,incorrect,The disadvantage is distance in this one and in a single fixed it is that the load's weight stays the same the whole time.
LP.16d.354.1,incorrect,This system would take longer to set up.
LP.16d.356.1,incorrect,Another disadvantage would be you have to pull more rope to get it where you want it to go.
LP.16d.357.1,correct,The effort is going up which makes it harder.
LP.16d.364.1,correct,"You would have to pull 3 times as much on this than you would a single fixed. Also, it is easier to pull down than up."
LP.16d.382.1,correct,"In a single fixed you have directional advantage, and you pull the rope as far as the load moves, but a single fixed or single movable up has no directional advantage, and you have to pull the rope 3 times as far."
LP.16d.385.1,correct,"You have to pull up. It may give you mechanical advantage, but it does not give you directional advantage so it takes just as much work."
LP.16d.387.1,correct,"Single fixed you can pull down, which does not give you a mechanical advantage. But you do not pull the rope farther than the load."
LP.16d.389.1,correct,This pulley system gives you a mechanical advantage the single fixed gives directional advantage.
LP.16d.419.1,incorrect,Distance.
LP.16d.498.1,incorrect,Another disadvantage might be that you cannot lift the load as high as you can in the single fixed because you are using more string.
LP.16d.499.1,incorrect,You have to pull twice as much rope to lift the load.
LP.16d.571.1,correct,A mechanical advantage. A single fixed pulley gives you a directional advantage.
LP.16d.592.1,correct,Another disadvantage might be the size of the load. 360 newtons is quite a large load to be pulling upward!
LP.16d.610.1,incorrect,You have to use less effort.
LP.16d.631.1,correct,"Compared to a single fixed pulley system, you would not have a directional advantage."
LP.16d.632.1,correct,You do not have a directional advantage.
LP.16d.638.1,correct,You have to pull up on this pulley system. On the single fixed you get a directional advantage.
LP.16d.647.1,correct,This system has a directional disadvantage and the single fixed has a mechanical disadvantage.
