MX.41.387.1,incorrect,No because no solid that one has more than the other in the same amount of water.
MX.41.392.1,incorrect,No not all mixtures and solutions come out correct he needs to let it sit or he should let or he should let I stir it.
MX.41.393.1,correct,Yes because different materials have different solubility.
MX.41.396.1,correct,Yes because different solids have different solubility is. Janet and Mike used different solids. They are wrong.
MX.41.399.1,correct,Yes it is possible both solubility's are correct different solubility's very possible because some substances are more able to dissolve in less space than others.
MX.41.400.1,correct,Yes because the water has different materials in it and the materials have different atoms and stuff and that makes changes to what happens to them in water and their solubility.
MX.41.421.1,incorrect,No because it has 2 different chemicals and it does not have the same solubilities.
MX.41.423.1,correct,Yes because they are whole new materials.
MX.41.424.1,correct,Because they are different ingredients.
MX.41.430.1,correct,Yes because they are 2 different ingredients.
MX.41.434.1,correct,Yes because the solubility is of mixtures are not all the same.
MX.41.436.1,correct,Yes because they are different materials.
MX.41.439.1,correct,Yes because they are both different.
MX.41.458.1,incorrect,Yes it is.
MX.41.468.1,incorrect,What do you mean I do not how what you are say to me so can you help me.
MX.41.486.1,correct,Yes because all material move in a different way.
MX.41.496.1,incorrect,Because they are different things. Nitrate is different then chloride so they cannot be the same weight. Just like a monkey and a elephant.
MX.41.503.1,incorrect,Yes because all materials have different grams.
MX.41.525.1,correct,Yes because they are 2 different things.
MX.41.541.1,incorrect,No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.
MX.41.542.1,incorrect,No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.
MX.41.563.1,correct,They are correct because the materials are 2 whole different materials.
MX.41.564.1,incorrect,Yes because something else can have the exact same thing and it does not have to be like that.
MX.41.566.1,incorrect,No because only a certain amount of solid can dissolve in a certain amount of water. They both got different solubility in the same amount of water which mean somebody did something wrong.
MX.41.572.1,incorrect,The fizzing means that it came from the gas.
MX.41.593.1,incorrect,Yes they can do it different but be the same way.
MX.41.596.1,incorrect,No because they are different grams.
MX.41.604.1,incorrect,No because they might weigh different.
MX.41.607.1,correct,Yes because Janet used silver chloride and Mike used silver nitrate which means if they used 2 different things they both could be right.
MX.41.611.1,incorrect,Yes because both the silver thing are different and they weigh different.
MX.41.613.1,incorrect,No because they used different chemicals so that why it is not the same and also because they used different sizes.
MX.41.639.1,incorrect,It could be possible chance it is correct but there could also be a 50 chance it is right and a 50 50 chance it is wrong. If they do not know they could do some test and research.
MX.41.643.1,incorrect,Yes because silver nitrate might be heavier.
