EV.35a.105.1,incorrect,"No, Because he changed 2 variables, food and calcium."
EV.35a.106.1,incorrect,"No, Because he needs to change one thing only so keep the food or calcium the same. Only change one thing."
EV.35a.107.1,incorrect,"No, He did not do a good job because he changed more than one variable."
EV.35a.109.1,incorrect,"No, He change more than one variable which make it not a controlled environment."
EV.35a.110.1,incorrect,"No, He changed 2 factors."
EV.35a.112.1,incorrect,"No, Andrew did not do a good job on controlling his variables because he did not take care of all of the fairly evenly for his variables. He had more than one variable."
EV.35a.114.1,incorrect,"No, No, he did not only use one variable, he used 2."
EV.35a.115.1,incorrect,"No, He did not because he gave different amounts of food and calcium, so it made a different for the chickens to lay eggs."
EV.35a.127.1,incorrect,"No, He gave group y more food and calcium."
EV.35a.130.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he had a lot of egg."
EV.35a.137.1,incorrect,"No, He did not did a good because he did not gave the same amount of grams and the right calcium for the group."
EV.35a.139.1,incorrect,"No, No because he did not control all variables accept for one, he changed all the variables accept for one."
EV.35a.141.1,incorrect,"Yes, Because it was controlled because there were 10 chickens in each group."
EV.35a.144.1,incorrect,"Yes, why because he maybe wanted to see the difference of the 2 chickens."
EV.35a.147.1,incorrect,"No, I think he did not do a good job because he should not had the same daily care."
EV.35a.148.1,incorrect,"No, No because he changed more than one variable."
EV.35a.156.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he did a graph and did grams for calcium for group one and chicken feed for group."
EV.35a.157.1,incorrect,"Yes, It was all organized and neat."
EV.35a.158.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because he did a good graph."
EV.35a.209.1,incorrect,"Yes, well he did quite feed them good."
EV.35a.210.1,incorrect,"No, Because he did not feed the chickens the same grams."
EV.35a.211.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he wrote everything down."
EV.35a.224.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes he recorded everything he did everyday."
EV.35a.233.1,incorrect,"No, because he is only supposed to change only one thing in his experiment."
EV.35a.234.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because he has all the stuff recorded right."
EV.35a.235.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he only changed one variable."
EV.35a.243.1,incorrect,"No, No he could have done it for a longer time of period."
EV.35a.245.1,incorrect,"No, Well, he did do a good job controlling the variables, but he needs to control one chicken at a time to get better results."
EV.35a.246.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he organized it so you can see what he did."
EV.35a.247.1,incorrect,"No, No, because he can only control one variable at a time."
EV.35a.248.1,incorrect,"No, He changed more than one variable."
EV.35a.253.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because if he did the same with both of the eggs it would be the same."
EV.35a.257.1,correct,"No, You should only have on different variable so you know why or why not the chickens laid more or less eggs."
EV.35a.258.1,incorrect,"No, No, because it is too much food and too much food of anything is unhealthy."
EV.35a.260.1,correct,"No, He changed 2 things we do not know if it worked or not."
EV.35a.261.1,incorrect,"No, Because was not controlling the environment."
EV.35a.263.1,incorrect,"No, because they might lay more egg than the others but maybe they just need a longer time with them."
EV.35a.381.1,incorrect,"Yes, because the variable helps you see the conditions of the chicken and helps you see the difference."
EV.35a.383.1,incorrect,Yes because he did different things to one group than the other also it was over a long period of time.
EV.35a.386.1,incorrect,"Yes, because there is the same amount of chickens but different amount of feed and calcium and how much eggs the chickens lay."
EV.35a.387.1,incorrect,Because he experimented that more feed equals more calcium and more calcium equally more eggs.
EV.35a.389.1,incorrect,"Yes, yes: because he had the same amount of information for each group and he gave all the important information."
EV.35a.395.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because it would be easier to observe them and maybe next time he knows what to do and how much food to feed them."
EV.35a.396.1,incorrect,"No, Because he should have put for experiment what the right temperature was and how much light they got."
EV.35a.397.1,correct,"No, He controlled 2 conditions at the same time so now he does not know which factor benefits the most."
EV.35a.400.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because he graphed everything and sorted mostly everything."
EV.35a.401.1,correct,"No, because he should of only had one condition that is different from the other not 2. That is so he knows what caused group y to lay more eggs than group x."
EV.35a.402.1,incorrect,"No, Because he gave them different amounts of both chicken feed and calcium."
EV.35a.406.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes, because he kept it neat and it was easy to follow."
EV.35a.407.1,incorrect,"No, because they are the same amount of chickens."
EV.35a.421.1,incorrect,"Yes, he gathered all the information and kept track. The calcium added is even with the chicken food and they have the same range."
EV.35a.422.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he fed them well and they laid a lot of eggs."
EV.35a.423.1,incorrect,"No, different conditions."
EV.35a.425.1,incorrect,"Yes, because all his chickens are still there and he laid eggs in the 100's, plus he took very good care of them, well!"
EV.35a.428.1,incorrect,"No, he tested 2 things at the same time he should only do one at a time."
EV.35a.433.1,incorrect,"Yes, He recorded everything he did."
EV.35a.441.1,incorrect,"Yes, yes, because he recorded everything and measured the amount it got."
EV.35a.444.1,incorrect,"No, No, because he did not test enough variables. He only used 2 groups with very different amount of daily care."
EV.35a.445.1,incorrect,"No, Andrew got the same amount of chickens. But, feed them different amounts of grams, to find out how many eggs the chickens would lay."
EV.35a.451.1,incorrect,"Yes, because at the end he had 109 eggs in group x and he had 140 eggs in group y."
EV.35a.457.1,incorrect,"No, Because he did not change any more than he needed too."
EV.35a.459.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he found out they lay more with 1300 grams of feed and 30 grams of calcium."
EV.35a.460.1,incorrect,"Yes, he did everything. Nothing was on it own."
EV.35a.461.1,incorrect,"Yes, he took accurate data."
EV.35a.462.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he can figure it out how much the foods or calcium will need."
EV.35a.463.1,incorrect,"No, No, because in group x he did not supply enough food and calcium as he did for group y."
EV.35a.464.1,incorrect,"Yes, Andrew did a good job he made sure the chickens had almost the same amount, it was also good because he had over a 100 eggs laid."
EV.35a.465.1,incorrect,"Yes, He made the daily care different to see what their optimum condition."
EV.35a.466.1,incorrect,"No, He needs to take more notes."
EV.35a.469.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because, he did not add factors he did not need and he did not change his."
EV.35a.472.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes, because he did correct info and he had good variables."
EV.35a.474.1,correct,"No, He did not do a good job of controlling the variables, because now you do not know what caused different results."
EV.35a.475.1,incorrect,"No, He had too many variables."
EV.35a.476.1,incorrect,"No, He should of recorded for each chicken separately."
EV.35a.487.1,incorrect,"No, he should record data for each chicken."
EV.35a.488.1,incorrect,"No, because he should have had a different number of tests with the grams section."
EV.35a.494.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he made the chicken laid eggs after 2 weeks."
EV.35a.503.1,incorrect,"Yes, because now he knows that more feed and more calcium for every 10 chickens produces more eggs."
EV.35a.504.1,incorrect,"Yes, yes because he did not go off the charts in daily care."
EV.35a.507.1,incorrect,"Yes, everything should have been the same besides one thing the thing he is testing."
EV.35a.509.1,incorrect,"No, On the calcium for group section he should have made them even like 10 and 30 grams, or else he did excellent."
EV.35a.510.1,incorrect,"Yes, yes because he did great in his experiment."
EV.35a.525.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he used one variable."
EV.35a.527.1,incorrect,"No, because you can get information of how much eggs they lay and the food for each group. Also the calcium for the chickens."
EV.35a.529.1,incorrect,"Yes, because the only thing changed was the chicken feed."
EV.35a.531.1,incorrect,"Yes, I think yes because it was well controlled and well organized. But he could have done better."
EV.35a.532.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because he put the number of chicken it was low."
EV.35a.534.1,incorrect,"No, because he did not control the variable."
EV.35a.536.1,incorrect,"Yes, Yes because Andrew fed the chickens a good amount so the chickens laid there eggs."
EV.35a.537.1,incorrect,"No, No, because the chickens got fed different amount and different amounts of calcium."
EV.35a.538.1,incorrect,"No, Because he recorded more than one variable daily care and egg production."
EV.35a.544.1,incorrect,"Yes, be the number of eggs laid by group y is a lot more than the eggs laid by group x."
EV.35a.545.1,incorrect,"No, no because after listing the same amount of chickens it cost different amounts?"
EV.35a.546.1,incorrect,Because he put too many chickens in one group and would not know which one laid eggs.
EV.35a.626.1,incorrect,"No, No because he is not controlling anything but the numbers of chicken."
EV.35a.636.1,incorrect,"No, because the should have put have look like every day."
EV.35a.638.1,incorrect,"Yes, because he writes how much chickens, how much he fed the chickens, how much calcium they got, even how much eggs they laid."
EV.35a.639.1,correct,"No, because he changed 2 things instead of one so he does not know which one works."
EV.35a.645.1,correct,"No, Because there were 2 things that were different in the experiment. The food and the calcium. So he will not know which one of those affected it."
EV.35a.647.1,incorrect,"No, Andrew should have given group x more calcium because 5 grams of calcium is not enough."
