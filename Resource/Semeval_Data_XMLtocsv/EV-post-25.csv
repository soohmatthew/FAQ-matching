EV.25.614.1,incorrect,It would not grow because it is used to saltwater and it would die.
EV.25.628.1,incorrect,Maybe the environment might change by taking the tree because maybe a tree keeps the place cool if you take it out it will be hot.

EV.25.633.1,incorrect,It would probably die because of all the different factors.
