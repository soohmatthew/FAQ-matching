LF.34b.103.1,incorrect,The river dries as it gets to the mountains.
LF.34b.108.1,incorrect,It flows that way because you cannot make a river flow uphill.
LF.34b.109.1,incorrect,Because it starts between a valley and mountains and goes the opposite direction.
LF.34b.137.1,incorrect,Because it flows down from the mountains.
LF.34b.177.1,incorrect,I think the water flows that way because it is going from happy valley to the river.
LF.34b.212.1,correct,Why is that the water flows down away from the mountain.
LF.34b.213.1,incorrect,Because it is big at beginning then slowly gets smaller and branches out.
LF.34b.216.1,incorrect,Because it goes happy valley then the river.
LF.34b.223.1,incorrect,Because it does not go into the mountain.
LF.34b.225.1,incorrect,The river flows from biggest to smallest. That is why.
LF.34b.253.1,incorrect,Because rivers sometimes end in valleys.
LF.34b.262.1,incorrect,The delta.
LF.34b.357.1,incorrect,Because the water flow to the basin which is the rose mountains.
LF.34b.667.1,correct,It flows in that direction because the water is going high land to low land.
LF.34b.668.1,incorrect,"Maybe because the mountains are that way, or there are cracks and the water goes through."
LF.34b.670.1,correct,Because the mountain is the highest peak and water flows downhill.
LF.34b.673.1,correct,I think that because the water flows down from the mountain first.
LF.34b.684.1,incorrect,Because there are little slots that take them that way.
LF.34b.707.1,incorrect,I think it flows that way because rivers usually flow from valleys into mountains.
LF.34b.734.1,incorrect,I think the water flows in that direction because the river is still trying to find the easiest route.
LF.34b.753.1,incorrect,Because the earth's gravitational pull.
LF.34b.768.1,incorrect,Because the river leads to an open delta.
LF.34b.769.1,incorrect,It flows in that direction because the mountain usually carries the water down the side of the mountain.
LF.34b.776.1,incorrect,I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow uphill.
LF.34b.779.1,incorrect,Rivers usually flow through valley. It grow weaker at the mountain because it cannot go uphill.
LF.34b.787.1,incorrect,There are other little streams at that end that was formed by water.
LF.34b.788.1,correct,Rivers cannot flow up mountain and valleys cannot be on mountain so it is flowing towards happy valley.
LF.34b.802.1,incorrect,"I think that way, because the water will flow down the mountain, not up it."
LF.34b.807.1,incorrect,All the streams flow together forming one bigger river.
LF.34b.810.1,incorrect,I think this because the stream is getting wider as it goes on.
LF.34b.811.1,incorrect,Because that is downhill.
LF.34b.817.1,incorrect,I think it flows there because the river eroded the valley and the water would be flowing down the valley.
LF.34b.819.1,incorrect,The river gets the water from the mountain and takes it to happy valley.
LF.34b.827.1,incorrect,I think the water flows in the direction because that is where the crack is.
LF.34b.840.1,incorrect,I think flows in that direction because it starts small and it gets bigger.
LF.34b.844.1,incorrect,I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow up a mountain.
