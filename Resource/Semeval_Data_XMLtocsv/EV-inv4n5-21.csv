EV.21.110.1,incorrect,If it turns yellow.
EV.21.111.1,incorrect,They hatched because they still put in 2 spoons of salt and 200 milliliters of water.
EV.21.112.1,incorrect,"Because not all the eggs would of just died because it is just salt, not poison."

EV.21.124.1,incorrect,Because it is supposed to.
EV.21.125.1,incorrect,Brine shrimp like salt.
EV.21.128.1,correct,Some eggs still hatched because brine shrimp are very salt tolerant.
EV.21.129.1,correct,Because it was still in the range of tolerance.
EV.21.130.1,incorrect,She did not put that much salt in.
EV.21.131.1,correct,I think some eggs still hatched because they could tolerate that much salt.
EV.21.132.1,correct,Because some could have different tolerances for salt.
EV.21.133.1,correct,The brine shrimp eggs still hatched because brine shrimp's eggs can hatch in an even saltier environment than 2 spoons of salt.
EV.21.136.1,correct,Some had still was the as much as it can handle.
EV.21.140.1,correct,Because it was in the range of tolerance.
EV.21.144.1,incorrect,"Because, they probably had the right amount to grow."
EV.21.145.1,correct,Because brine shrimp can still live in a little bit more than just 2 spoons of salt.
EV.21.146.1,incorrect,It probably made the process faster.
EV.21.148.1,incorrect,Because there was still salt in the water.
EV.21.150.1,incorrect,Because if there is salt still in the water the brine shrimp might still hatch.
EV.21.153.1,incorrect,It takes I think brine shrimp at least one years to hatch or less.
EV.21.154.1,incorrect,Because the water still has some salinity or salt in it.
EV.21.158.1,incorrect,Because of the water and salt mixed in still.

EV.21.163.1,incorrect,Because she only put 2 spoons of salt and some eggs hatched because it was not the right amount of salt.
EV.21.171.1,correct,Slightly mean only a little more or less. Since it was only a little more or less they still hatched.
EV.21.172.1,incorrect,Maybe because it is still 2 spoons of salt. Maybe it worked because it still has 2 spoons of salt but a little bit more because the spoon was probably bigger.
EV.21.180.1,incorrect,"Because my class did a experiment and put less spoons of salt, but something still hatched but not as much as 2 spoons."
EV.21.182.1,incorrect,Some eggs still hatched because the most salt the better.
EV.21.183.1,incorrect,"Because, they put water and a lot of salt, so they will hatch more and more."
EV.21.185.1,incorrect,Eggs hatched because the eggs from the first time hatched when Mrs. Larson added more salt in a different size spoon it was too much salt. That is why some of them did not hatch.
EV.21.194.1,incorrect,Some eggs still hatched because they did more and because they did it right.
EV.21.195.1,incorrect,There was probably just a salt in it.
EV.21.196.1,incorrect,Because of the leftover salt. And egg inside. And she probably put a lot of salt.

EV.21.219.1,incorrect,Some eggs hatched because you do not need a certain amount of spoons of salt unless there is not too much.
EV.21.222.1,correct,Some eggs still hatched because those eggs can tolerate that much salt and water.
EV.21.226.1,incorrect,"Because brine shrimp hatch in saltwater, and because she put salt in the water they will hatch."
EV.21.241.1,incorrect,Because the spoon could have been smaller than the other spoon.
EV.21.243.1,correct,Some eggs liked the environment.
EV.21.244.1,correct,Since the 2 spoons with the new spoon was still in the range of tolerance.
EV.21.245.1,incorrect,"Some eggs still hatched, because of the salt."
EV.21.250.1,incorrect,The eggs hatched since the water was not saturated.
EV.21.254.1,incorrect,She still put salt in the cups and she did not.
EV.21.255.1,correct,The water must have dissolved some of the salt and the amount of salt that was left over must have been enough for the brine shrimp eggs to hatch and to tolerate.
EV.21.256.1,correct,Because it is just a little more than before.
EV.21.263.1,incorrect,Because maybe she only put one spoon of salt and it was the same amount of salt of 2 spoons.
EV.21.264.1,incorrect,Because even though she used a different spoon the salt amount might have changed slightly.
EV.21.265.1,incorrect,Some eggs still hatched because it was still in saltwater.
EV.21.276.1,incorrect,She put too much water or too much salt.
EV.21.278.1,incorrect,Because it still had salt in it and brine shrimp need it.
EV.21.279.1,incorrect,Because the water diluted some of the salt.
EV.21.288.1,correct,"Because the amount of salt is still in the brine shrimp's range of tolerance, one spoon of milliliters to 2 spoons of milliliters."
EV.21.289.1,incorrect,Because there was probably too much salt in one place and just right in another.
EV.21.298.1,incorrect,They hatched because the eggs had the right amount of water and the right amount of water.
EV.21.301.1,correct,Because it still in the range of tolerance.
EV.21.316.1,correct,Because it was close to the optimum condition so that way some still hatched.
EV.21.317.1,correct,Some eggs still hatched because maybe the brine shrimp liked that amount of salt.
EV.21.326.1,incorrect,Some eggs hatch because brine shrimp live in saltwater so some of them hatch because of the saltwater in it.
EV.21.331.1,incorrect,Some eggs hatched because the optimum condition was 2 spoons of salt. She added 2 spoons of salt but she used a different sized spoon.
EV.21.418.1,incorrect,She used more salt than she wanted to.
EV.21.419.1,correct,Because the range of tolerance of salt is 2 spoons to 4 or 5 with that size spoons.
EV.21.423.1,correct,"As long as there is the right or more amount of salt, eggs will hatch."
EV.21.425.1,incorrect,Because there was still salt in there and if there is salt then they will hatch.
EV.21.427.1,correct,"Because 2 spoons of salt was the best and just a little would not hurt the eggs. It was like our experiment, though they had different salinity levels they all hatched, except for cup 0."
EV.21.431.1,incorrect,Because it was a little past the range of tolerance.
EV.21.433.1,incorrect,More eggs need more salt.
EV.21.436.1,incorrect,The eggs still hatched because she still put the salt but with a different amount.
EV.21.437.1,incorrect,"Because salty water can hatch shrimp eggs, and maybe if there is too much salt the eggs might not even hatch."
EV.21.444.1,incorrect,Because there was salt and some eggs are viable.
EV.21.446.1,incorrect,She had just added a little more salt which she might have not tested.
EV.21.523.1,correct,Because some shrimp have a bigger range of tolerance.
EV.21.524.1,correct,The water was all in the same range and the water was the same so they could of hatched.
EV.21.526.1,correct,The eggs do have a tolerance of hatching. Not all will hatch because of the different solution in the water.
EV.21.527.1,incorrect,Because the spoons were just a little bit different. One was a little bit bigger than the other. Because they have to live in saltwater or they would die.
EV.21.529.1,correct,Because that spoon size was in the range of tolerance.
EV.21.530.1,correct,Maybe because the salt amount was maybe in its range of tolerance of salt. So only a little bit hatched.
EV.21.531.1,incorrect,Because maybe she put too much or too little.
EV.21.532.1,incorrect,I think that some of the eggs will hatch and some are not.
EV.21.533.1,incorrect,Because he put more salt in one so some did not hatch.
EV.21.534.1,incorrect,Because even if she used a bigger size spoon she still used saltwater.
EV.21.535.1,correct,Well probably some brine shrimp have more range of tolerance of salt.
EV.21.537.1,incorrect,Because the spoons might have just been twice the size. And instead of 2 spoons it is 4 if it is double.
EV.21.541.1,incorrect,Because the spoons were just a little bit different one was a little bit bigger than the other. Because they have to live in saltwater or they will die.
EV.21.542.1,correct,The salt was all in the same range and so was the water.
EV.21.543.1,incorrect,The spoon might have been the twice of the size.
EV.21.547.1,incorrect,Because there is still salt in the cups.
EV.21.548.1,incorrect,Not a lot of salt.
EV.21.549.1,incorrect,If she put 100 milliliters of salt in the brine shrimp will hatch or not.
EV.21.632.1,incorrect,As long as you do not use too much of a different size.
EV.21.639.1,correct,Some eggs can still hatch because it can still hatch even with more salt.
EV.21.640.1,incorrect,Because the spoon was smaller.
EV.21.642.1,incorrect,Because the water would still have some salt in it. So the brine shrimp hatched because they are attracted to salt.
EV.21.643.1,incorrect,"Some of the eggs might have hatched because of the salt and brine shrimp live in salty water, saltier than the ocean."
EV.21.646.1,incorrect,Because maybe she did use the right one later. How about the spoon was bigger that is why.
EV.21.647.1,incorrect,Some eggs hatched because there was salt in the water. Salt helps brine shrimp hatch.
