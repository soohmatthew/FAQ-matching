LF.33b.175.1,correct,It will end up there because clay can be broken up into such tiny parts or sediments that it is easily carried by the water and will end up probably the farthest out in the lake.
LF.33b.176.1,incorrect,The clay is deposited there because it is lighter so it travels farther and spreads out more.
LF.33b.177.1,incorrect,The deposited where I indicated because clay is a lot heavier than sand and pebbles.
LF.33b.183.1,incorrect,Because clay is a bigger.
LF.33b.213.1,incorrect,Because clay is heavier than sand so it travels farther.
LF.33b.216.1,incorrect,Clay deposited where I indicated because the clay is the lightest in this case.
LF.33b.223.1,incorrect,Because it is so light.
LF.33b.253.1,incorrect,Because when we did our stream table experiment the water and clay mixed and the water and the clay flowed together.

LF.33b.662.1,correct,Clay is where I indicated it because clay is the lightest material so it travels the farthest.
LF.33b.664.1,incorrect,It was deposited because it begins to settle to the bottom because the channel is slowing its current.
LF.33b.665.1,incorrect,The clay is deposited where I indicated because the river has brought the clay in the lake.
LF.33b.668.1,incorrect,"It is deposited because the water, river is taking it away with it."
LF.33b.680.1,correct,The clay goes the farthest because it has the least particles.
LF.33b.682.1,incorrect,The clay is deposited where I indicated it because it is heaviest so it will not go as far.
LF.33b.685.1,correct,The clay is lighter so it is carried farther.
LF.33b.689.1,correct,The clay is there because it has lighter and smaller particles which makes it float to the top.
LF.33b.699.1,incorrect,Because clay is the lightest.
LF.33b.701.1,correct,The clay is deposited there because the clay is the lightest and everything else is heavier so it sinks.

LF.33b.738.1,incorrect,Very near to the mouth of the river.
LF.33b.784.1,correct,The clay is very light so it can be carried farther than the sand and pebbles.
LF.33b.802.1,correct,"The clay is deposited there, because the clay has the least amount of mass so it will go farther."
LF.33b.814.1,incorrect,The clay is deposited where I indicated because the clay has the lesser mass so it is can be carried the farthest.
LF.33b.825.1,correct,It was deposited there because it has a lesser mass and therefore is carried farther than all of the other earth materials.
LF.33b.837.1,incorrect,The clay is where I indicated it because it is the one that gets pushed out the farthest.
LF.33b.844.1,correct,Clay is lighter than sand or pebbles so it would be easier for water to carry it farther.
LF.33b.922.1,correct,The clay is deposited where I indicated because it is the lightest.
LF.33b.937.1,incorrect,The clay deposit is farther because of its light weight.
LF.33b.940.1,incorrect,The clay is indicated where I put it because clay is soft and lines are soft too.
