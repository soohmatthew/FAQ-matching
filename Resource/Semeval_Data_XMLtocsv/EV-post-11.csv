EV.11.101.1,correct,"Range of tolerance is a range of what it likes, optimum is what it likes."
EV.11.105.1,correct,"The optimum condition is what they prefer, the range of tolerance is what they can stand."
EV.11.107.1,correct,"The range of tolerance is the environments it could survive in, the optimum condition is the best condition to live in."
EV.11.110.1,correct,The range of tolerance is the range it can grow in. The optimum condition is the condition it grows best in.
EV.11.114.1,correct,"Range of tolerance is many environments the plant can survive in, optimum condition is the best."
EV.11.116.1,incorrect,One of them includes their environment and one is them being together.
EV.11.120.1,correct,Range of tolerance is how much they can handle and optimum condition is the best environment.
EV.11.124.1,incorrect,One to 8.
EV.11.126.1,incorrect,Its range of tolerance is its climate range.
EV.11.128.1,incorrect,It is how much it can handle.
EV.11.131.1,incorrect,Range of tolerance is a range. Optimum condition is for something living.
EV.11.145.1,incorrect,It is what the organism can tolerate or handle.
EV.11.150.1,correct,Its range of tolerance is like a scale and the optimum condition is on that scale.
EV.11.152.1,incorrect,"The tolerance is where it handles organism, is the same as the other one."
EV.11.160.1,incorrect,They are all in one.
EV.11.206.1,incorrect,They are both how good the organism grows or lasts.
EV.11.209.1,incorrect,Do not get it?
EV.11.211.1,correct,Optimum condition is best condition. Range of tolerance is preferred condition.
EV.11.222.1,correct,A range of tolerance means what is the highest amount it can handle and what is the lowest amount it can handle. An optimum condition is the best amount of something.
EV.11.227.1,incorrect,They both mean where they live with that environmental factor.
EV.11.227172.1,incorrect,"Opposite, because range of tolerance means most likely to die, optimum means best condition. The best condition is the one that is preferred like the brine shrimp. Optimum condition is preferred. Range of tolerance is when it is going to die, not in right optimum condition."
EV.11.227180.1,correct,"Range of tolerance and optimum are both about environments, but range of tolerance is what environment can they stay in without dying and optimum is the one they like the best."
EV.11.229.1,correct,Range of tolerance means what is the least amount of something it can take to the highest amount. Optimum condition means what does it want.
EV.11.234.1,incorrect,The temperature is.
EV.11.242.1,incorrect,The optimum condition is a controlled environment and range of tolerance is like how much water and what is the temperature it can live in.
EV.11.254.1,correct,"A range of tolerance is what is the lowest to the highest of something that an organism can live in, and a optimum condition is the best place for an organism to grow in."
EV.11.256.1,incorrect,The range of tolerance is how far something can handle. A optimum condition is leaving it the same.
EV.11.258.1,incorrect,Organisms living and the other is not living.
EV.11.262.1,incorrect,An range of tolerance is how high or how low something is.
EV.11.276.1,incorrect,Well because they could tolerate a condition by a range.
EV.11.279.1,incorrect,They are conditions the organisms can live in.
EV.11.282.1,correct,The optimum is where it is supposed to be and the range is where it can be.
EV.11.286.1,incorrect,They both have range of tolerance.
EV.11.296.1,incorrect,In both conditions the organism can still grow.
EV.11.312.1,incorrect,"The relationship between an organism's range of tolerance and its optimum condition is how it grows, whether it grows good or bad. How much it will grow under a set of conditions."
EV.11.317.1,incorrect,Is how much it can stand water. And where it can grow best.
EV.11.320.1,incorrect,They both have places where an organism can live and stay.
EV.11.322.1,correct,The relationship of range of tolerance and its optimum condition is which organism can stand the best and which organism grows the best.
EV.11.328.1,correct,The relationship is that the optimum condition is somewhere in the range of tolerance.
EV.11.331.1,incorrect,The relationship between the 2 is that all organisms have them.
EV.11.386.1,incorrect,I think the relationship is that they both have something to do with how much something grows.
EV.11.389.1,incorrect,"With the organisms range of tolerance, it tells about the growth and its optimum condition is."
EV.11.407.1,incorrect,I think the range of tolerance is different effect.
EV.11.419.1,incorrect,You are trying to find what the organism's favorite place is.
EV.11.428.1,correct,"The optimum condition is the best and range of tolerance is what it survive in, optimum condition equals thrive, range of tolerance equals survive."
EV.11.441.1,incorrect,"They need water, food, and a habitat."
EV.11.454.1,correct,An organisms optimum condition is within its range of tolerance.
EV.11.456.1,correct,His optimum condition is in his range of tolerance.
EV.11.459.1,correct,Optimum conditions is what it needs and range of tolerance is what it will survive in.
EV.11.461.1,correct,The optimum condition is the peak of the range of tolerance.
EV.11.463.1,incorrect,They both tell what an organism needs.
EV.11.465.1,correct,Range of tolerance is the highest that it can hold before it can grow any more. Optimum condition is the condition that they can handle.
EV.11.477.1,incorrect,They are places where the organisms can live.
EV.11.488.1,correct,"A range of tolerance is where it can live, a optimum condition is what weather it lives best in."
EV.11.492.1,correct,Range of tolerance is what the organism can survive in. Optimum condition is the best environment for the organism.
EV.11.496.1,incorrect,They are 2 different things.
EV.11.500.1,incorrect,Range of tolerance is when you see what the best environment for a plant of animals. An optimum condition is what the condition of a plant is.
EV.11.507.1,incorrect,Do not remember.
EV.11.509.1,incorrect,They both have certain amounts of water and seeds.
EV.11.524.1,incorrect,Range of tolerance means how far will it live and optimum means what condition it is so it is the same.
EV.11.530.1,incorrect,The plant will always grow.
EV.11.531.1,incorrect,You can do a table.
EV.11.546.1,incorrect,Well it both have to be controlled variable.
EV.11.626.1,incorrect,They have to do with nature stuff.
EV.11.646.1,incorrect,"Optimum is best thing that animals needs and organism is an animals, Living things."
