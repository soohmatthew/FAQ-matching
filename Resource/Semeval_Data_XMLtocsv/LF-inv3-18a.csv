LF.18a.101.1,incorrect,It depends on if it has a slope or no slope.
LF.18a.114.1,correct,A flood will make the creek overflow faster and will make more damage.
LF.18a.120.1,incorrect,It flows faster and carries lots of birdie.
LF.18a.122.1,incorrect,With normal water flow there is not as much water than a flood.
LF.18a.148.1,correct,The flood water rises and goes really fast picking up sand and dirt.
LF.18a.184.1,incorrect,Water flows with a lot more force normal water goes a lot less fast.
LF.18a.189.1,incorrect,They both create erosion.
LF.18a.221.1,correct,"During a flood the creek's volume will increase greatly, the water will run faster, and there will be mudslides, compared to normal water flow, which is constant and steady, and erodes less."
LF.18a.223.1,incorrect,"It will flow fast and crazy, but with a normal one it floods slow and calm."
LF.18a.248.1,incorrect,The water flow in a creek during a flood is different from normal water flow because the water during a flood would flow more rapidly than the normal flow.
LF.18a.256.1,correct,The difference between a flooded creek and a normal creek is water level and water pressure.
LF.18a.258.1,incorrect,"During a flood, the water flow is faster and heavier."
LF.18a.265.1,correct,The water goes faster and the water gets higher and it start to overflow.
LF.18a.281.1,correct,The water flows quickly during floods and also the water is high and normal water flows pretty calm and is not usually as high as water is during floods.
LF.18a.282.1,correct,The water in a chart is much higher during a flood and it goes faster.
LF.18a.284.1,correct,The water rises and starts getting wavy and out of hand.
LF.18a.285.1,incorrect,In a flood it would spread farther.
LF.18a.288.1,correct,In a flood the water flows faster than in normal water level.
LF.18a.289.1,incorrect,A creek usually flows slowly and floods usually flow quickly.
LF.18a.295.1,incorrect,It flows faster because of the water current pushing the other one.
LF.18a.350.1,incorrect,It will flow faster and might swerve off track.
LF.18a.352.1,correct,The writer in the flood goes faster and more water comes out at once.
LF.18a.673.1,incorrect,The water in the creek during a flood is more capped than a normal molten. During a flood the water runs through more quickly and picks up earth materials in deposition first and takes them further. Also erosion happen more quickly.
LF.18a.674.1,correct,The water would flow much faster and rise above the marshes. During a normal day the water would not be moving very fast and if would not be over the marshes.
LF.18a.676.1,incorrect,When there is a flood the water flow is much faster. It is also stronger.
LF.18a.678.1,incorrect,It flows faster.
LF.18a.701.1,incorrect,The water flows a lot faster during a flood compared to the speed flowing during a normal flow.
LF.18a.702.1,incorrect,It overflows in a creek and a lake on river.
LF.18a.779.1,incorrect,In a flood the water would be moving stronger and faster than usual.
LF.18a.801.1,incorrect,Flood water has a great velocity and force.
LF.18a.811.1,incorrect,The water overlaps the area around the creek during a flood.
LF.18a.823.1,correct,The water goes out of its channel. The water speeds up.
LF.18a.825.1,incorrect,The water in the creek during a flood will flow much harder and faster causing more and more erosion compared to water flow without creek.
LF.18a.838.1,incorrect,It is compared to different speed a flow patterns.
LF.18a.848.1,correct,The water flows in a faster range than normal because there is more water.
LF.18a.940.1,incorrect,The water flow in a creek during a flood compared to normal water flow is the same.
